Unprice is built on the core principle of **PriceOps**. Unlike traditional billing systems that treat pricing as a static configuration, Unprice treats pricing as a dynamic, iterative growth lever that should be decoupled from your application code.

## The PriceOps Methodology

Unprice follows the **PriceOps** methodology—the practice of treating pricing as an agile product surface rather than a backend detail. It allows for:

- **Rapid Iteration**: Change pricing models, tiers, and limits without touching a single line of application code.
- **Safety**: Immutable plan versions ensure that existing customers are never accidentally affected by pricing changes.
- **Organizational Alignment**: Marketing and Growth teams can own the pricing strategy, while Engineering focuses on building features.

## Core Concepts

To understand how Unprice handles pricing, you need to be familiar with three main components:

### 1. Features
Features are the building blocks of your product. A feature could be anything from "API Requests" to "SSO Support" or "Project Storage". Each feature has a specific **type** that defines how it's priced.

### 2. Plans
A Plan is a collection of features offered together as a package. A plan itself doesn't have a price; instead, the pricing is defined in its **Versions**.

### 3. Plan Versions
Plan Versions are immutable snapshots of a plan at a specific point in time. They define the specific costs, limits, and configurations for each feature. When you want to change your pricing, you create a new Plan Version and publish it.

## How Calculation Works

Unprice automatically calculates the total price for a customer based on their subscribed Plan Version and their current usage. It handles:

- **Proration**: Automatically calculating partial costs when a customer upgrades, downgrades, or changes their plan mid-cycle.
- **Multi-currency**: Native support for different currencies and rounding rules.
- **Complex Models**: Seamlessly mixing flat fees, tiered consumption, and package-based bundles.
