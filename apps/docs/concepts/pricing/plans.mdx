description: "How pricing works"

---

Many products today are delivered as a service, with a tiered pricing model based on access to the service ("seats"), a measure of consumption of some aspect of the service ("metering"), or some combination of these.

The 5 Pillars of PriceOps define a methodology for pricing model definition and implementation that supports iteration, safety, and organizational alignment.

## Why you should use Unprice?

As matter of fact you shouldn't, if you don't want to prepare for the upcoming market change in pricing for software as a service, you can continue with the old paradigm. Unprice is the by product of putting some foundational principles in practice to move from static monetization to adaptive monetivation. We explain more in detail in our [manifesto](https://unprice.dev/manifesto). You could follow those principles to build your own stack.

## Isn't this just a wrapper for Stripe?

Yes, you are absolutly right. Unprice has an interface to communicate with different payment providers, not only Stripe. The main value you get from Unprice is the iteration on prices, the ability to change payment providers and the analytics insights. The idea is not let you vendor lock and adapt quickly to pricing changes.
