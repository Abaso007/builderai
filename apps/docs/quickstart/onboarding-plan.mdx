Integration with Unprice is designed to be seamless. Follow these steps to start managing your pricing.

## 1. Configure your Model
Pricing in Unprice is decoupled from your code. You define your model in the dashboard first.

1. **Create a Plan**: Give it a name like "Pro" and a slug like `pro`.
2. **Create a Plan Version**: Plans are versioned so you can safely iterate.
3. **Add Features**: Define what you are selling (e.g., "API Requests") and choose a pricing type (Flat, Tiered, or Usage-based).
4. **Publish**: Once published, your version is ready to accept subscriptions.

## 2. Install & Initialize
Install our type-safe SDK and initialize it with your Project API Key.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @unprice/api
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @unprice/api
```
</CodeGroup>

```typescript
import { Unprice } from "@unprice/api";

const unprice = new Unprice({
  token: process.env.UNPRICE_TOKEN // Found in your Project Settings
});
```

## 3. Verify Access (Entitlements)
Before performing an action, check if the customer has access and if they have enough balance for the specific operation.

```typescript
const { result } = await unprice.customers.can({
  customerId: "cust_123",
  featureSlug: "ai-generations",
  usage: 5 // Check if they can consume 5 units right now
});

if (result?.allowed) {
  // 1. Perform your operation...

  // 2. Then report the usage to update their balance
  await unprice.customers.reportUsage({
    customerId: "cust_123",
    featureSlug: "ai-generations",
    usage: 5,
    idempotenceKey: "unique-id-for-this-request"
  });
}
```

## 4. Subscribe a Customer
Subscribe a customer to your latest plan version in a single call. Unprice handles the checkout redirect and provider linking.

```typescript
const { result } = await unprice.customers.signUp({
  email: "user@example.com",
  planSlug: "pro", // Subscribes them to the latest version of 'pro'
  successUrl: "https://yourapp.com/dashboard",
  cancelUrl: "https://yourapp.com/pricing"
});

// Redirect the user to the checkout URL provided in result.url
```
