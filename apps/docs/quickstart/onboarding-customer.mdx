## Overview

Once you create and published your first plan, you are ready to subscribe customers to it. Here is when the beauty of Unprice comes in. Because plans are inmutable, every customer you subscribe  never will have some side effect when there are new versions of the same plan.

Customer subscribes to a specific plan versions, which is way you can iterate on the prices without affecting current customers.

You could migrate customer from one version to another, or change the plan entirely as well.

There are 2 main ways to create customer in Unprice. The recommended way is through our API or SDK. You can also use the [Dashboard](https://app.unprice.dev).

    SignUp method can be use to get the latest version of a plan and subscribe to it, or you can pass a specific plan version ID. More info [here](/libraries/ts/sdk/overview)

    ```ts
    // subscribe to the lastest version of the plan PRO
    const { result, error } = await unprice.customers.signUp({
      name: "John Doe",
      email: "customer@example.com",
      planSlug: "PRO",
      externalId: "your_database_id",
      successUrl: "https://example.com/dashboard",
      cancelUrl: "https://example.com/login"
    });

    if (error) {
      // handle potential network or bad request error
      // a link to our docs will be in the `error.docs` field
      console.error(error.message);
      return;
    }

    console.log(result);
    ```
