Unprice simplifies the complex world of billing by acting as an intelligent orchestration layer.

## 1. Multi-Provider Support
Unprice is designed to work with multiple payment providers. While Stripe is the primary integration, the architecture allows for switching or using multiple providers simultaneously.

## 2. Automated Billing Cycles
- **Anniversary Billing**: Customers are billed on the same day they signed up each month.
- **Calendar Billing**: All customers are billed on a specific day of the month (e.g., the 1st).
- **One-time Charges**: Support for non-recurring fees and add-ons.

## 3. Proration & Credits
One of the most complex parts of billing is handled automatically by Unprice:
- **Upgrades**: Credit is applied for the unused portion of the old plan towards the new plan.
- **Credit Grants**: Issue credits that automatically get applied to future invoices.

## 4. Payment Methods
Manage customer payment methods securely. Unprice stores the provider-specific references (like Stripe payment method IDs) so you never have to handle sensitive card data directly.
