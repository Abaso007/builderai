Subscriptions represent the relationship between a customer and a specific plan version.

## 1. Creating Subscriptions
Most subscriptions are created via the SDK when a customer signs up, but you can also manage them manually in the Dashboard:
- **Assign a Plan Version**: Choose the specific version the customer should be on.
- **Billing Cycle**: Unprice automatically tracks the start and end of the billing period.

## 2. Managing Subscription Life Cycle
- **Upgrades & Downgrades**: When a customer changes plans, Unprice calculates the proration automatically.
- **Cancellations**: Subscriptions can be canceled immediately or at the end of the current period.
- **Renewals**: Managed automatically based on the plan version configuration.

## 3. Usage & Limits
For each subscription, you can view the real-time usage of all metered features:
- **Current Usage**: See exactly how much a customer has consumed in the current cycle.
- **Remaining Balance**: Monitor how close a customer is to their limits.

## 4. Invoicing
Unprice generates internal records for every billing event, which are then synced to your payment provider (like Stripe) for actual payment collection.
