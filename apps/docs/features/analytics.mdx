Unprice Analytics provides a deep dive into how your pricing strategies are performing.

## 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Track the health of your business with built-in metrics:
- **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)**: Real-time calculation of your subscription revenue.
- **Churn Rate**: Monitor customer retention and plan cancellations.
- **Conversion Funnels**: See how customers move from signup to their first paid plan.

## 2. Usage Heatmaps
Understand how your features are being used:
- **Feature Adoption**: Identify which features are most popular across your plans.
- **Usage Distribution**: See if customers are hitting their limits and if there's an opportunity for new tiers.

## 3. Plan Performance
Compare different plan versions to see which ones drive the most revenue or have the highest retention. This is critical for the "Iteration" pillar of PriceOps.
