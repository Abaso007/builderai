The Plans section is where you define your product offerings and their pricing models.

## 1. Creating a Plan
Navigate to the **Plans** tab in your dashboard and click "New Plan". You'll need to provide:
- **Name**: The name of the plan (e.g., "Scale").
- **Slug**: A unique identifier for your SDK calls (e.g., `scale`).
- **Description**: A brief summary of what this plan includes.

## 2. Defining Features
Once a plan is created, you can assign features to it. For each feature, you must select its pricing type:
- **Flat**: Fixed price.
- **Tier**: Volume or Graduated pricing.
- **Usage**: Consumption-based.
- **Package**: Bundle pricing.

## 3. Managing Versions
Every plan in Unprice uses versioning. When you want to change a price or add a feature:
1. Create a **New Version** of your plan.
2. Configure the new pricing and limits.
3. **Publish** the version to make it available for new subscriptions.

<Info>
  Existing customers will remain on their current version until you choose to migrate them, providing a safe way to iterate on pricing.

## 4. Plan Settings
- **Enterprise Plan**: Mark plans as enterprise to hide them from public listings and handle custom pricing.
- **Default Plan**: Set a default plan for new signups.
