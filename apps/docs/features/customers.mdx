The Customers section provides a 360-degree view of every customer using your product.

Each customer in Unprice has a unique `unpriceCustomerId`. This ID is used to link your application's users to their billing and entitlement data.

## 2. Key Information
- **Active Plan**: The plan version currently assigned to the customer.
- **Entitlements**: A list of all features the customer can access.
- **Usage History**: Historical consumption data across multiple billing cycles.
- **Payment Methods**: Linked credit cards or payment provider details.

## 3. Operations
From the Customer dashboard, you can:
- **Reset Entitlements**: Manually reset usage counters if needed.
- **Grant Credits**: Add one-time or recurring credits to a customer's balance.
- **Update Metadata**: Store custom key-value pairs for integration with other systems.
