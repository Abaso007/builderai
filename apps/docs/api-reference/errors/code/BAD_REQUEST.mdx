## Problem

You do not have permission to perform this action. In most cases this means the root key you are using, is lacking permissions.

## Solution

Go to the [Unprice Dashboard](https://app.unprice.dev) and add the required permissions to your key.

If that doesn't help, ask for help on [Discord](https://unprice.dev/discord)
