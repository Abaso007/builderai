The Unprice API uses HTTP methods and generally follow the schema:

```
https://api.unkey.dev/{version}/{service}/{method}
```

For example `GET https://api.unprice.dev/v1/plans/getPlanVersion` to get the configuration of a plan.

## HTTP Methods

We strictly use only `GET` and `POST` methods. `PUT` and `DELETE` are not used.

### `GET`

`GET` methods are used for reading data. Filtering, sorting, or pagination is done via query parameters.

```http
curl "https://api.unprice.dev/v1/plans/getPlanVersion/plan_123"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>"
```


### `POST`

`POST` methods are used for creating, updating, and deleting data. Data is passed as `application/json` in the request body.

```http
curl -XPOST "https://api.unprice.dev/v1/plans/listPlanVersions"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>"
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  -d '{
    "onlyPublished": true,
    "onlyEnterprisePlan": false,
    "onlyLatest": true,
    "billingInterval": "month",
    "currency": "USD"
  }'
```
