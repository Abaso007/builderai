**Stop hardcoding your revenue.** Unprice is the open-source PriceOps infrastructure that decouples your pricing models, limits, and entitlements from your application code.

## The 3-Second Value
- **Decouple**: Move plans, tiers, and limits from code to a dynamic dashboard.
- **Independence**: Launch new pricing experiments without a single JIRA ticket or deployment.
- **Adaptive Models**: Built-in support for Usage-based, Tiered, and Hybrid pricing with automated capture.

## What is Unprice?

Unprice acts as an intelligent PriceOps layer between your App and payment providers (like Stripe). We handle the complexity of:
1. **Usage Metering**: Aggregating consumption across any period or scope.
2. **Entitlements**: Real-time verification of what a customer can actually do.
3. **Adaptive Revenue**: Automated proration, invoicing, and cross-provider management.

## Why PriceOps?

Most SaaS billing is static and brittle. Changing a price requires engineering effort, testing, and deployment. Unprice follows the **PriceOps** methodology, allowing Growth teams to own the pricing strategy while Engineering focuses on the core product.
